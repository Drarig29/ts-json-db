A Node.js database using JSON file as storage. The result of requests are **typed**!

It's a wrapper around [node-json-db](https://github.com/Belphemur/node-json-db) which does the main job about the "database". This package is inspired by [RESTyped](https://github.com/rawrmaan/restyped) and its autocomplete and type checks.

## Installation
Add `ts-json-db` to your existing Node.js project.
```bash
npm install ts-json-db
```
